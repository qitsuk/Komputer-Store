# Komputer-Store
First Assignment at Experis Academy. Did my best with the styling, but it is what it is. Revisions may occur.

All the functionality is there, but I may have overdone it with the comments.
This is because, I normally never comment my code (even though I know i should), so this is quite new to me.

Also, probably not the cleanest code I've ever written. Time is a factor. Again, revisions may occur.

# USAGE

# Try it, before you buy it!
